description: "time-series-machine-learning/tsml-eval is a Python project for running experiments on time series machine learning algorithms and evaluating the results. Write code that adheres to PEP8 and is formatted to the Black code style. The projects documentation is built using Sphinx and MyST, and unit testing is done using pytest."

rules:
  - "There should not be large chunks of code that are just commented out. Docstrings and explanations in code are okay though."
  - "Update the relevant API page in 'docs/api.md' when new public functions and classes are added and not included in the API documentation. Only add functions and classes which are not already in the relevant API documentation and avoid duplicate entries. Files in 'tsml_eval/publications/ do not need to be added to the API documentation."
