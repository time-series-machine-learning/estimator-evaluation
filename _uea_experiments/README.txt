This directory contains instructions and utilities for running experiments using tsml-eval on University of East Anglia (UEA) hardware.

For non-UEA users, the folders contents are not relevant. Some of the contents could be adapted for other purposes, but running the scripts or following the hardware instructions will achieve nothing.
